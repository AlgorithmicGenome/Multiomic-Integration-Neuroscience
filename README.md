# Multiomic-Integration-Neuroscience
This dataset is part of the Single cell and spatial multiomics identified Alzheimer's disease markers Application Note.

Wild-type and CRND8 APP-overexpressing transgenic male mice brains were collected at 2.5, 5.7, 13.2, and 17.9 months of age. Each brain was separated into its hemispheres, where one was fresh frozen (FF) and the other formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE).

For FF hemispheres, nuclei were isolated following the Demonstrated Protocol for Nuclei Isolation from Complex Tissues for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (CG000375 Rev B). Paired ATAC and Gene Expression libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression User Guide (CG000338 Rev D).
